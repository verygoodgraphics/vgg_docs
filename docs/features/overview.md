title: VGG Features
---

This documentation provides illustrations of each feature that is defined by VGG Specs and implemented
by VGG Runtime.

Currently VGG Features only covers the following specs:

- [VGG Vector Graphics Spec](/specs/vectorgraphics/overview)
- [VGG Layout Spec](/specs/layout/overview)

VGG Runtime is an official implementation of VGG Specs and is available [here](https://github.com/verygoodgraphics/vgg_runtime).
