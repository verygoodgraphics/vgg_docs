## Who is VGG designed for?

VGG is designed for two kinds of people:

- Designers who want to make serious applications, rather than simple
  prototypes.
- Developers who want to spend more time on business logic, rather than UI
  code.

When these two roles are combined, VGG serves independent developers, or as
they are commonly called, indie hackers. They are both full-stack frontend
designers and developers that always want a quick development process to turn
ideas into real applications.

## What's the goal of VGG?

The application development process, and particularly UI design and
development, can be tedious, monotonous and low efficient.

VGG aims to make the process of application UI design and development more
efficient by:

- Eliminating the need for continuous communication efforts between designers
  and developers.
- Reducing duplicated work efforts, such as reimplementing the UI with code to
  ensure it's pixel-perfectly the same as the original design.

VGG also aims to provide the best developer experience, along with
cross-platform capability and ecosystem compatibility.

## Why call it Design-as-Code? I believe it's just another design-to-code tool.

Not exactly. VGG doesn't convert designs into web codes like HTML/CSS/JS.
Instead, it depends on [Daruma](https://verygoodgraphics.com/daruma) to convert
designs into files that conform to VGG Specs. Of course, these are also codes,
but they differs from web codes not only in the representation but also in the
level of abstraction.

We use the term Design-as-Code because VGG seamlessly combines design and code,
which led us to coin this phrase.

## Is it a low-code product?

Not really.

## What is VGG Runtime and what's the use of it?

[VGG Runtime](https://github.com/verygoodgraphics/vgg_runtime) is an engine
with two primary functionalities:

- The first is its complete 2D vector graphics capability, dedicated to
  rendering high-fidelity design files as user interfaces (UIs).
- The second is the ability to program and run design files as applications,
  providing more power than simple prototypes.

VGG achieves its goal by combining these two features. However, you can also
build a professional vector graphics editor like Figma or even Illustrator
based on the first graphics capability alone. VGG already provides a solid
foundation for this with a vector graphics specification and a rendering
implementation.
