title: "Step 2: Develop"

After obtaining a VGG design file, you can use it as the basis of your
application, or only one part of your application that will eventually be
mixed into your existing application.

There are two ways to develop on top of a VGG design file:

1. Using native VGG Runtime.
2. Using VGG Container for your target platform and framework.

Currently, we recommend the latter, as it allows you to write business logic
code directly using the host language, and it's the same VGG container for
deployment. The first method won't be covered in this documentation site, but may
appear in VGG Runtime's own documentation.

So, please refer to [VGG Containers](/containers/overview) to choose one for your
host platform and framework and start developing.
