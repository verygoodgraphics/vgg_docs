title: VGG Workflow
---

_VGG Workflow_ is an innovative workflow for rapid application development
(RAD), which is based on [VGG Specs](/specs/overview) and its implementation,
[VGG Runtime](https://github.com/verygoodgraphics/vgg_runtime).

## First Principle

The first principle of _VGG Workflow_ is to bridge the huge gap between the two
worlds of design and development, eliminating duplicate development work
(writing code to reimplement UI which is already created by designers using
design tools) and accelerating the application development process.

## Design-as-Code

The concept of _Design-as-Code_ is simple and intuitive. As _VGG Workflow_
allows developers to focus on writing business logic code using their familiar
and preferred development tools and languages directly on top of the design
files. Developers don't have to endure various style sheets including CSS or its
derivatives.

## Ecosystem Compatibility

What's more, thanks to [VGG Containers](/containers/overview), developers can
deploy the final outcomes of _VGG workflow_ to any platforms with any
frameworks. This means it is completely compatible with the existing code base
and doesn't even have vendor lock-in problems that are commonly identified in
low-code tools.

In short, it is an enhancement to your original workflow, not a burden.

## Workflow Division

_VGG Workflow_ could be divided into three steps:

1. Design
2. Develop
3. Deploy

Let's go through each of them step by step.
