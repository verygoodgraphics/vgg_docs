# VGG SDKs

VGG SDKs provide VGG APIs to VGG users, allowing them to access the underlying
data of VGG Daruma and the functions of VGG Runtime. These SDKs are used in
conjunction with VGG Components and VGG Widgets.

For example, the VGG JavaScript SDK may be used in conjunction with VGG React
component as it is a web UI framework with JavaScript programming language. The
reusable VGG widgets can be developed with one VGG SDK and used with another
VGG SDK in a different language.
