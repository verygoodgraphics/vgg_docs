# VGG FAQ

## Who is VGG designed for?

VGG is designed for two kinds of people:

- Designers who want to make serious applications, rather than simple
  prototypes.
- Developers who want to spend more time on business logic, rather than UI
  code.

When these two roles are combined, VGG serves independent developers, or as
they are commonly called, indie hackers. They are both full-stack frontend
designers and developers that always want a quick development process to turn
ideas into real applications.

## What's the goal of VGG?

The application development process, and particularly UI design and
development, can be tedious, monotonous and low efficient.

VGG aims to make the process of application UI design and development more
efficient by:

- Eliminating the need for continuous communication efforts between designers
  and developers.
- Reducing duplicated work efforts, such as reimplementing the UI with code to
  ensure it's pixel-perfectly the same as the original design.

VGG also aims to provide the best developer experience, along with
cross-platform capability and ecosystem compatibility.

## Why call it design-as-code? I believe it's just another design-to-code tool.

Not exactly. VGG doesn't convert designs into web codes like HTML/CSS/JS.
Instead, it converts designs into Daruma format which is both a design format
and an application format.

We use the term __design-as-code__ because VGG seamlessly combined design and
code, which led us to coin this phrase.

## Is it a low-code product?

Not really.

## What can I do with VGG Runtime?

[VGG Runtime](https://github.com/verygoodgraphics/vgg_runtime) is an engine
with two primary functionalities:

- The first is its complete 2D vector graphics capability, dedicated to
  rendering high-fidelity design drafts as user interfaces (UIs).

- The second is the ability to program and run design drafts as applications,
  providing more power than simple prototypes.

VGG achieves its goal with the combination of these two features. However, you
can also build a professional vector graphics editor like Figma or even
Illustrator based solely on the first graphics capability. VGG already builds a
solid foundation for it with a graphics definition ([Daruma Design
Format](https://verygoodgraphics.com/daruma/formats/design)) and a rendering
implementation.
