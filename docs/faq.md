# VGG FAQ

## Who is VGG designed for?

VGG is designed for two kinds of people:

- Designer who wants to make serious applications (rather than using low-code
  platforms).
- Developer who don't want to write manual UI code (by utilizing mainstream
  design tools as UI builders).

These two roles combined, VGG is best suited for indepedent developers (i.e.,
indie hackers) because, by nature, they are both full-stack frontend designers
and developers.

## What's the goal of VGG?

The application development process, and particularly UI design and
development, can be tedious and monotonous, but we often have no better
options. The design problem may be mitigated with the help of AIGC, but
development still requires manual effort if you want a project with clean code
and a flexible architecture.

VGG aims to make the process of application UI design and development more
efficient by:

- Eliminating the need for continuous communication efforts between designers
  and developers.
- Reducing duplicated work efforts, such as reimplementing the UI with code to
  ensure it's pixel-perfectly the same as the original design.

VGG also aims to provide the best developer experience, along with
cross-platform capability and ecosystem compatibility.

## Why call it design-as-code? I believe it's just another design-to-code tool.

Not exactly. VGG doesn't convert designs into web codes like HTML/CSS/JS.
Instead, it converts designs into Daruma format which is both a design format
and an application format.

We use the term __design-as-code__ because VGG seamlessly combined design and
code, which led us to coin this phrase.

## What can I do with VGG Runtime?

[VGG Runtime](https://github.com/verygoodgraphics/vgg_runtime) is an engine
with two primary functionalities:

- The first is its complete 2D vector graphics capability, dedicated to
  rendering high-fidelity design drafts as user interfaces (UIs).

- The second is the ability to program and run design drafts as applications,
  providing more power than simple prototypes.

VGG achieves its goal with the combination of these two features. However, you
can also use the first graphics capability to create a professional vector
graphics editor like Figma or even Illustrator. It's important to note that VGG
is free and open source, but please read the [VGG
License](https://verygoodgraphics.com/licenses/LICENSE-1.0) before utilizing
it.
