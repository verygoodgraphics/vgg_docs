## Overview

### Introduction

Welcome to the VeryGoodGraphics (VGG) example documentation page! Here we'll take you on a deep dive into the power and flexibility of VGG through a series of well-designed examples. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, these examples will give you valuable insights and help you quickly master VGG in different scenarios.

To learn how to import the VGG container and its dependencies depending on your development framework, see the [Containers page](https://docs.verygoodgraphics.com/containers/overview).

Now, let's start this journey of exploring VGG Examples!



### **Example Types**

VGG Examples is divided into three tiers, each targeting specific usage scenarios and development granularity to ensure you can efficiently build and customize your applications. Below are the three component types we offer:

**Basic components**

- These are the most basic UI building blocks, such as buttons, labels, checkboxes, and more.
- Basic components give you fine-grained control over the precision with which you can build complex user interfaces.
- They provide a solid foundation for creating more complex components and templates.

**Composite components**

- Composite components are components that combine multiple base components to meet specific functional requirements, such as navigation menus, form components, data presentation components, and so on.
- These components are preconfigured and optimized to reduce your development effort and help you quickly implement common interaction patterns.
- By using composite components, you can increase development efficiency while maintaining a consistent and professional user interface.

**Template components**

- Templates are high-level components designed for specific page types, such as landing pages, user dashboards, blog/article pages, etc.
- They combine several composite and base components to provide you with a complete framework for page layout and design.
- Templates are ideal for getting started quickly and implementing project concepts, helping you build compelling user interfaces in no time.



### Structure

For each component's presentation page, we have used an intuitive structure to show the relationship between the code and the rendered result, so you can easily understand the purpose and effect of each component.

#### Code section

- **View the code**: The complete source code of the example is provided on the left side of the page. You can browse through the code to understand the exact implementation and configuration of the components.
- **Code segmentation**: For longer code examples, we have segmented或备注 them and clearly mark the functionality of each section with comments.
- **Copy and paste**: You can copy and paste the code snippets directly into your own projects for experimentation and learning.

#### Rendering section

- **Live preview**: On the right side of the page is the live preview area, which instantly shows the rendering of the code on the left.
- **Interactive experience**: If the example contains interactive features, you can interact with the components directly in this area to experience the actual effect.
- **Effect comparison**: To help you better understand the relationship between the code and the effect, we provide interaction tips and effect descriptions.

### How do I use these examples?

Each example is designed as a standalone module that you can explore by following these steps:

1. **Read the code**: First, read the code on the left side carefully and try to understand the function of each code segment.
2. **View the effect**: Then watch the rendering on the right to see how the code is translated into the visual interface.
3. **Try changes**: Try making changes to the code and observe how these changes affect the rendering on the right side.
4. **Go deeper**: Use other resources in the documentation, such as API references and best practices, to deepen your understanding of VGG containers.

We encourage you to try, modify, and extend these examples to suit your own project needs. With practice, you will gain a deeper understanding of the power of VGG and be able to apply it to a variety of innovative UI designs.
