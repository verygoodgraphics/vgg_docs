# VGG Components

VGG application not only runs
[indepdently](https://github.com/verygoodgraphics/vgg_runtime) but also
functions as a component compatible with an existing UI framework.

Whether it's a small div, a medium section or an entire page, the VGG component
takes control of that area and helps eliminate the need to recreate complex UI
effects from design drafts in that specific area.

Currently only [VGG React component](react.md) is available. Other components
are comming soon.
