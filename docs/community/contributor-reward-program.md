:::info[NOTE]
This program only applies to [VGG Runtime](https://github.com/verygoodgraphics/vgg_runtime)

:::warning
This program is a WIP and will be detailed in the future. The essence won't change regardless.
:::

## Why do we need this program?

VGG Runtime is open-sourced under a conditionally free [license](https://verygoodgraphics.com/licenses/LICENSE-latest),
which differs from common open-source licenses and may cause confusion for open-source contributors. Questions like "Am
I working for this commercial project for free?" or "Why do I have to contribute to this commercial project?" may arise.

VGG Contributor Reward Program (CRP) addresses these concerns by sharing profits from the VGG License to well-recognized
VGG community contributors.

## Who is enrolled in this program?

By contributing to VGG Runtime (with at least one PR merged), you are automatically enrolled in this program.

## What criteria must be met for the reward?

You need to be recognized by VGG Group as a core contributor. VGG Group will make a fair judgment.

## How much I can get?

It depends. If zero profit is generated from VGG License, you'll get nothing substantial except for your public
contribution records.

All royalty fees paied to VGG will be published online.
