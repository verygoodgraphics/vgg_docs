VeryGoodGraphics (VGG) Community is devoted to facilitating the development and adoption of the
VGG Project, including VGG Specs, VGG Runtime, VGG Containers, and other VGG-related technologies.

VGG Community consists of different roles, including core members, contributors, and users.

## As Core Members

VGG Group is a group of people consisting of the core members of the VGG Project. You can learn
more from [VGG Goverance](/community/goverance).

## As Contributors

All developments happen in VGG's GitHub [organization](https://github.com/verygoodgraphics), where
VGG core members and contributors work on the VGG Project together. Any contributor should read the
following before making any contribution to the VGG Project.

All VGG projects are open-sourced under the MIT license, except for VGG Runtime which is open-sourced
under a conditionally free license. There is an [Contributor Reward Program](/community/contributor-reward-program)
if you would like to contribute to the VGG Runtime.
